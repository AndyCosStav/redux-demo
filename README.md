A simple but powerful Todo app built with React and Redux Toolkit to demonstrate clean global state management, reducer-based updates, and local persistence.
 Tech Stack

    React (with hooks)

    Redux Toolkit (createSlice, configureStore)

    React-Redux (useSelector, useDispatch)

    LocalStorage (for persistence)

 What This App Demonstrates

This project is designed to showcase a solid understanding of Redux and modern state management in a React application.
 Key Concepts Covered:

    Setting up a Redux store using configureStore

    Organizing logic into modular slices using createSlice

    Using reducers to handle state changes predictably

    Accessing state globally with useSelector

    Updating state with dispatch

    Managing derived UI state (filtering, editing)

    Persisting Redux state to localStorage

    Clean component design using local + global state together

What I’ve Learned

Through building this, I’ve gained a deeper understanding of:

    How to structure Redux logic in real-world apps

    When and why to use Redux over useState or Context

    The importance of normalized, centralized state for scalability

    How Redux empowers clean, predictable state flow across an entire app

To Run this:

    npm install 

    npm run dev
